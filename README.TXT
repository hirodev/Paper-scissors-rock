Here is a simple a problem with a simple requirement. It's a good example of when not to use design patterns because there is not much likelihood of the need for expansion, and even if there was, using design patterns would likely make this overly complicated. If I did use a design patter, I could use the visitor pattern so that the functionality of who beats who could be determined outside of the hand gesture classes. For this game, we could use a singly linked circular list to represent the structure of who beats who. I chose to put it in a map because it's easy to maintain. There are numerous different directions I could have gone with this project. I could have full use of object oriented program. Again, such a small program doesn't call for it. Premature optimization is a common pitfall.
